OCR
=====

Input
-----
Input will consist of a bitmap image containing text
in the Arial font.

Output
-----
Output will consist of the text identified in the image.

Title
-----
Titles under consideration include

- OCR
- Ocular Conformation Resolver
- Grapheme Resolver

Steps
-----
The general steps involved in the algorithm will include

1. Loading the image file
2. Preprocessing, such as:
    - noise removal
    - determining threshold level
3. Dividing page horizontally into lines
4. Dividing lines vertically into letters
4. Identifying letters

Identifying letters
-----
This is the most complicated step.

One algorithm I'm considering is to check a number of parallel lines at certain
predetermined angles (perhaps eventually with a choice of different angle
configurations for different fonts), and identifying those that contain a large
number of foreground pixels. This would probably be easier with sans-serif
fonts.

Identifying if and how many holes are in the image would also be helpful.
The breadth-first search would come in useful here. 

Possible class and method structure
-----
* TextPage - Recognizes a page of text
* TextLine - Recognizes a line of text
* Grapheme - Recognizes a letter
